"""
This example shows how to run the MCP server and the FastAPI app separately.
You can create an MCP server from one FastAPI app, and mount it to a different app.

# Mount the MCP server to a separate FastAPI app

# Run the MCP server separately from the original FastAPI app.
# It still works ðŸš€
# Your original API is **not exposed**, only via the MCP server.
